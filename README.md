# Numerical-Methods-Algorithms
This repository features a collection of MATLab algorithms written for MECH-105 at Colorado State University.
These functions use a variety of numerical methods to find some sort of data (more specific documentation can be
found in each README.md file in each respective folder).  

## `falsePosition.m`  
The `falsePosition.m` function estimates the root of a user defined function given bracketed guesses.

## `luFactor.m` 
The `luFactor.m` function uses LU Decomposition to factor a square matrix. This decomposition can be used 
to find inverse matrices and other useful information.

## `Simpson.m`  
The `Simpson.m` function uses the Simpson's 1/3 Rule to estimate the integral of user given experimental data.
As long as the data is evenly spaced, this function can estimate the integral of any experimental data.
