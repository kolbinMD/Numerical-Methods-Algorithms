# LU Factorization Function Documentation
### Description  
The program `luFactor.m` uses LU Decomposition and outputs the lower triangular matrix, the upper 
triangular matrix, and the pivot matrix.

**`Inputs`**  
  * A- the matrix to be factorized (must be a square matrix)  
  
**`Outputs`**  
  * L- lower triangular matrix containing the ratios used for elimination  
  * U- upper triangular matrix containing the results of the Gauss elimination with pivoting  
  * P- a permutation matrix that describes the resulting matrix of pivoting
